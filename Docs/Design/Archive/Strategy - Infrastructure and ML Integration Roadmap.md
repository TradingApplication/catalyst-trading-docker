**Target**: Personal Trading Application with Professional ML Capabilities  
**Timeline**: 12 months to full implementation  
**Budget**: $24-150/month scaling with success  

---

## Executive Summary

This strategy integrates cloud infrastructure scaling with machine learning development to create a sophisticated trading application that grows intelligently with your needs. Starting with a simple $24/month setup, the system evolves through three phases to incorporate advanced ML pattern detection, catalyst-based stock selection, and outcome prediction.
